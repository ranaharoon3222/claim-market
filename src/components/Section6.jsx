                    If you use Claims Market's Simple Assignment of Claim
                    (“SAC”), there is no need to negotiate legal terms. This

                    negotiating time and money is minimized since the Buyer only
                    needs to focus on the Seller's specific red-lined changes to
                    the SAC.
